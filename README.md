# SoftwareDesignDocument

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 
Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, was looking to develop a web based game based on their current Android game, Draw It or Lose It.
  
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think that I did very well on the design constraints and domain model sections. I went into details about the client's requirements and how to implement them.
  
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful 
when developing the code?
  Creating this document helped me understand that web-based applications for mobile devices are not the same as web applications for PCs. The operating systems for mobile devices are different and cannot support all of the same functions that a PC can, like Adobe Flash.
  
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would 
you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could revise one part, I would choose to the memory management section. I explained how Linux uses it, but did not sugguest a technique that the client should use for development. I just assumed that it would mainly be handled by the Linux operating system and the cloud based provider.
  
5.How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? 
Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I utilized the description given about the company and their needs to make a short summary. Next, I make note all of the requirements and made notes of which designs and languages would be best to fulfill the requirements. From there I can compare all of the architecture designs and languages to determine what I need for development. It is always important to consider user's needs because users will not use an application they do not understand.
  
6.How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use 
in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  The main thing I did was use my notes and research more design requirements that I did not understand. For future projects, I will always be sure to first compare the available operating systems to the program that needs to be designed. Once the operating system has been chosen, it is a lot easier to figure out the rest of the design constraints.
